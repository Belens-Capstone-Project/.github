## About The Project

Managing sugar intake is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, identifying the sugar content in packaged beverages can be challenging for consumers, as even though the ingredients are listed, some people often overlook them, leading to an unhealthy lifestyle.

Belens was created to address this issue by utilizing advanced technology. The app allows users to scan beverage packaging for sugar content, as well as beverage grade and recommendations to avoid over-consumption. By providing this information, the user instantly knows what is important about the drink.

### Key Features:

- **Instant Scan:** Utilize the app to scan beverage packaging and get sugar content information by simply taking a photo of the front of the beverage without having to scan a specific part.
- **Personalized Insights:** Get recommendations and insights based on health goals.

Belens is not just a tool, itâ€™s a companion for anyone looking to prioritize their health while enjoying their favorite drinks.

With Belens, making healthier choices has never been easier. Our mission is to foster a more health-conscious society through innovative technology.
